## Collaboration Setup Guide

Concise beginner's guide on getting everything set up.

### Background

You don't have to download any new software (unless you want to). Nearly everything will be handled inside a web browser.

### Steps

1. Create GitHub account using this [link](https://github.com/)
2. Send me your GitHub username so I can add you to org & repo
3. Use your GitHub account to log into [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/)
4. Clone the repo

An alternative to Posit Cloud is [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
